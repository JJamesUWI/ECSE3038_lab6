# LAB 3

## Aim

This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing an embedded module as part of an IoT system and RESTful API server.

## Requirements
Designing a project that will be used to manage a system that monitors the status of a set of electronically measured water tanks. The embedded circuit attached to each water tank will measure the height of the water in the tank and report on the tank's current occupancy as a percentage of its maximum capacity.

Our role is to design a RESTful API that allows each IoT enabled water tank to interface with your server so that the measure values can be represented visually on a web page. **The use of a cloud-based database is also to be employed.**

Our API should also support the maintenance of a simple user profile.

Our server should be able to perform the actions of a simple HTTP web server. The server should be able to perform actions on a resource such as Create, Read, Update and Delete. **This is to be done with the use of a mongodb database.**

Our server should be designed to host at least 7 specific HTTP routes. They are:

 ```py
POST /data
```
